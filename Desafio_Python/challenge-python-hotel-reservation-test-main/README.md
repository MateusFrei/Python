Nearly empty Python3 project with a failing test!
===

**DO NOT change the names of the function (get_cheapest_hotel) or of the file and folder it is in, changing it implies in disqualification.** 

**Ensure that you have Python 3 installed and that your PIP installation points to it**

To install the required modules:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or
```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```


To run the (failing) test:

```
$ py.test
```

**After implementing your solution, it should pass the unit tests available.**
